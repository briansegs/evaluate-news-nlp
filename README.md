# Project Introduction

This project is a single page web app that takes any sentence and processes it through an API to give you a sentiment analysis back. "Sentiment Analysis API" is MeaningCloud's solution for performing a detailed multilingual sentiment analysis of texts from different sources.

The text provided is analyzed to determine if it expresses a positive/negative/neutral sentiment; to do this, the local polarity of the different sentences in the text is identified and the relationship between them evaluated, resulting in a global polarity value for the whole text.
